I don't like being outdoors, Smithers. For one thing, there's too many fat children. I'm normally not a praying man, but if you're up there, please save me, Superman. Well, he's kind of had it in for me ever since I accidentally ran over his dog. Actually, replace "accidentally" with "repeatedly" and replace "dog" with "son." Oh, loneliness and cheeseburgers are a dangerous mix.

Uh, no, they're saying "Boo-urns, Boo-urns." Here's to alcohol, the cause of — and solution to — all life's problems. A lifetime of working with nuclear power has left me with a healthy green glow…and left me as impotent as a Nevada boxing commissioner. Please do not offer my god a peanut. Save me, Jeebus.

You don't like your job, you don't strike. You go in every day and do it really half-assed. That's the American way. You don't win friends with salad.

Inflammable means flammable? What a country. Son, a woman is like a beer. They smell good, they look good, you'd step over your own mother just to get one! But you can't stop at one.

I've had it with this school, Skinner. Low test scores, class after class of ugly, ugly children… Slow down, Bart! My legs don't know how to be as long as yours. The Internet King? I wonder if he could provide faster nudity… A woman is a lot like a refrigerator. Six feet tall, 300 pounds…it makes ice.
