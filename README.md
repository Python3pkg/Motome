Description
===========

Motome is a note taking application inspired by Notational Velocity, ResophNotes and nvPY. Some of its features are:

 - Markdown rendering
 - History tracking and the ability to see diffs
 - Note tagging
 - Note search and creation from a single input
 - Note merging & export
 - Auto-saves notes in the background
 - Keyboard shortcuts
 - Handles image syntax for image files in the note directory

Some of the motivation behind Motome:

 - All note data is yours and stored on your computer
 - All notes are stored in future resistant file formats (unicode text and zip files)
 - Notes can have histories

Motome is cross platform and has been tested on Windows 7 and OS X 10.6.8.
