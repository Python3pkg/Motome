Description
===========

Motome is a note taking application inspired by Notational Velocity, ResophNotes and nvPY. Some of its features are:

 - Note search and creation from a single input
 - Markdown rendering
 - History tracking and the ability to see diffs
 - Note tagging
 - Note merging & export
 - Auto-saves notes in the background
 - Keyboard shortcuts
 - Drag and drop files to create links

Some of the motivation behind Motome:

 - Notes are yours and stored on your machine, not on someone else's servers
 - Notes are stored in easily accessible text files, not in a database or proprietary format
 - Notes can have histories

Motome is developed with Python and Qt and is cross platform.
